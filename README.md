# K-Nearest-Neighbors
Implementing K nearest neighbors in Python.
KNN is a classification algorithm in Machine learning which calculates distance between K neighbors and the new data point is classified 
based on that distance. The distance which is least to particular class, the new data point belongs to that class.
Distance calculation can have many approaches like Eucladian,cosine,manhattan and minkowski.

In this implementaion I used Eucladian distance as default and varying the value of K for maximum accuracy solution.
